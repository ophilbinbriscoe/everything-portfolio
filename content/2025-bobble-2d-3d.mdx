## Context

While completing my undergraduate studies in computer science, I took introductory and advanced game dev courses.

One of our assigments was to clone Taito's 1994 “Puzzle Bobble” arcade game using Unity, first in 2D, then 3D.

## “Bobble Runner” (2D)

For the 2D clone, I styled the game after Blade Runner (one of my favourites).

I added a few extras on top of the assignment requirements:

- lots of juice (animations, screen shake, particle effects)
- a terminal-style gameplay printout to the left of the gameplay area
- an over-the-top level transition effect

## “Jurassic Basket Bobble” (3D)

For the 3D clone, I decided to play off dinosaurs and basketball.

One of the additional requirements for this assigment was to include a difficulty selection menu.

The extras this time were:

- a 3D splash screen, built as a separate scene
- an animated dinosaur bone ball feeder
- lots of environment art
