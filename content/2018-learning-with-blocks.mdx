## Context

My younger sister, school-age but already an avid gamer, was interested in learning how games were made.

We used one of the core features from her favourite game (Minecraft) as a learning prompt.

## What we did

Using Unity, I walked her through how to build:

- a simple volumetric data structure to store block data
- a simple character controller
- basic block editing
- basic UI elements and debug drawing

We also made the art assets together in Photoshop.
