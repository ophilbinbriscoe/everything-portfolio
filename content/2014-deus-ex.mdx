Before starting my undergrad, I was employed for a year and a half at Eidos Montreal on their forthcoming
flagship project, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided.

I worked closely with art, design, and programming teams to deliver integration-heavy gameplay elements.

## Train station cutscene

One of the features I worked on as a scripter was a constrained free-look during this extended interactive cutscene.

This was something I built using the basic camera, input, and math nodes that
the [Dawn Engine](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Engine:Dawn_Engine)'s visual scripting tools already provided.
