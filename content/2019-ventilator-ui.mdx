## Context

In the first months of the COVID, a global challenge was issued for a new, affordable ventilator that could address supply shortages of this lifesaving equipment around the world.

At the time, I was working for Haply Robotics, who decided to participate in the challenge while their other funding sources were on hold due to the pandemic.
