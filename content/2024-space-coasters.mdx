## Context

Over the holidays, I was had some time to kill and was interested in trying out the latest version of Unity 6.

I had always loved simulation games, and thought that it would be fun to prototype an RCT-like game set in space.

### What I built

I mocked up a few systems for this prototype:

- track mesh generator, with supports
- custom rollercoaster physics
- guest queueing system
- guest arrival/departure system
- basic object placement system

Here are a few screen captures.

## Disclaimers

The only assets I used for this project were Aron Granberg's [A* Pathfinding Project](https://arongranberg.com/astar/) (for guest pathing), and the [Linework](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/linework-outlines-and-edge-detection-294140) asset for object outlining.

The project also relies on Unity's built-in [Splines](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.splines@2.4/manual/index.html) package, which provides a basic Bezier curve solver.

All of the art assets (character models, props) are CC0 or generated at runtime (track geometry).
