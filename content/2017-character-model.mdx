## Context

While completing my undergraduate studies in computer science, I participated in a Ubisoft Game Lab challenge with a few of my peers.

The challenge was to create an asymmetrical 2-player game.

I worked on several areas of this project, but I wanted to highlight the 3D character model I created for it.

## Auto-riggin test

I used 3DS Max to create the model, and [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/) to auto-rig and animate the character (which worked quite well for this project).
