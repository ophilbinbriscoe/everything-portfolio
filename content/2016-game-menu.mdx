## Context

While completing my undergraduate studies in computer science, I took introductory and advanced game dev courses.

One of our group assignments was to build a turn-based game with a main menu, level select, and options.

I worked on several areas of the project, but I wanted to highlight this one as I was its sole contributor.

## Video

This video shows off the background scene, button animations, and state transitions (my work); followed by some of the gameplay (not my work).
