## Context

While completing my undergraduate studies in computer science, I worked with one of my professors on a way to visualize time-series gaze tracking data.

The motivation was to intuitively visualize the temporal information that gets lost when looking at a static heatmap or gaze plot.

## Approach

Using Unity, particles are stochastically instantiated over the heatmap and animated according to the time-series gaze tracking data. 

## Outcome

I completed my studies before we got any results, but I did get permission to retain a screen recording of one of the visualizations.
