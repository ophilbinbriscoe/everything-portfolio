# A bit of everything

This is the Next.js source repo for https://everything-portfolio-kappa.vercel.app/gallery.

The project is based on the [Nextfolio](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/nextfolio-a-simple-next-js-portfolio) template.

I made a few tweaks:

- rudimentarty video support in the `MediaGrid` component
- tweaked page names/nav to be project-oriented
- automatic sourcing of gallery media from project files
- removed socials and RSS feed
- added a Behance link
